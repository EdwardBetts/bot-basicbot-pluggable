=head1 NAME

bot-basicbot-pluggable - A standard Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable script

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A standard Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable interface. You can /query the bot to
load in more modules. Change the admin password ASAP - 
See perldoc L<Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Auth> for details of this.

=head1 USAGE

  bot-basicbot-pluggable --nick MyBot --server irc.perl.org

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --server

The server to connect to. Defaults to I<localhost>.

=item --configfile FILE

Read config options from specified FILE. For a discussion of possible
value and format refer to the section CONFIGFILE. The default to read
the configfile found by L<Config::Find>.

=item --nick

Nickname to use. Defaults to I<basicbot>.

=item --channel

Channel to connect to. This paramter may be provided several times.

=item --password

Sets the admin password of the I<Auth> module. This also loads the I<Auth>
module implicitly.

=item --module

Modules to load. This paramter may be profided several times. You can
call --list-modules to get a list of all available modules. If you do
not define any module via this option, I<Auth> and I<Loader> are loaded
by default.

=item --list-modules

Lists all installed modules and exits afterwards. No bot is started.

=item --list-stores

Lists all installed storage modules and exits afterwards. No bot is
started.

=item --store

Defines which storage module is used to save module settings. The default
is I<Memory>, which does not save any settings between sessions but does
neither leave any files nor need any special settings. You probably want
to load I<DBI> or any of the other storage modules in the long run.

=item --charset

Charset to use for the bot. Defaults to I<utf8>, but you can use
any encoding listed in L<Encode>. The IRC protocol doesn't define
a specific character-set to use.  This presents a big problem,
because if you do not use the same as everybody else in the channel
you just receive garbage.

=item --port

Port to connect to on target host. This defaults to the irc standard
port 6667. You won't need to define this in most cases.

=back

=head1 CONFIGFILE

The bot read a configfile either found by L<Config::Find> or specified
on the comamnd line via I<--configfile> on startup. The file should
be a synatctical corrent yaml file with a hash on the first level. It
understands every option listed above and the special settings paramter,
which is a hash, where the keys are module names and the value is a hash
of configurable module settings. Easier to show than to explain:

 server: host
 nick: bot
 settings:
   Karma:
     self_ignore: 0

All modules listed under settings are also loaded on startup.
