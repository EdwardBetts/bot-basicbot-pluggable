Revision history for Perl extension Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable.

0.xx xxxx/xx/xx
  - Revised documentation for Pluggable.pm and Module.pm.

0.50 2004/01/18
  - Moved Bot::BasicBot::Pluggble::Module::Base to B::B::P::Module.pm,
    and added Base.pm as an empty subclass, for neatness.
  - Documented the object store methods better.
  - Changed all core modules to use the proget get/set store methods.
  - Loader now uses the standard store system.
  - Installed shell script to run B::B::P.
  - The Infobot module can now passively learn and passively answer questions
    (without direct addressing) and you can set these options seperately.
  - The storage system is decently abstracted out, and has a
    default that does the same thing as the last one.
  - Gave the bot a default charset of utf8, because I'm a fan of utf8.
  - Utterly changed the Infobot back-end store system. Updating it will be
    a pain, I'm sorry, but the last one really sucked. Re-wrote the Infobot
    module to be _readable_, or at least slightly less nasty than before.
    
0.30
  - Improved docs.
  - Synced version number with Bot::BasicBot again.
  - Added NINJA support.
  - Moved to Module::Build-based module layout.
  - Huge docs improvement, based on feedback from people who
    clearly had no idea what I was smoking at the time.
  - Decent examples in examples/, and web page copies for people who use CPAN.
  - Removed Blog and Shout modules - Blog to be spun off
    into a seperate module, Shout was just stupid.
  - Support for loading modules from 'Modules' in cwd as well as main lib path.
  - The bot is a lot less case-sensitive. Still sensitive for loading
    modules, but all the help, etc commands are more friendly.
  - Removed 'reply' method (now in Bot::BasicBot).
  - Slight module API changes, nothing significant:
    - Added a 'tick' callback that happens every 5 seconds.
    - Added a 'reply' local method that mirrors the Bot::BasicBot reply.
    - Added a 'say' method that calls the Bot::BasicBot say.
    - Added a very simple 'tell' method for simple statements.
    - Added an 'emoted' callback that works identically to 'said'.
    - Added a 'chanjoin' callback, called when someone joins a channel.
    - Added a 'chanpart' callback, called when someone leaves a channel.
  - Module changes (other than doc improvements):
    - Auth:
      - Fixed silly bug that meant you didn't actually need to auth.
      - Now requires direct addressing.
      - Smarter about ignoring things that aren't admin commands.
    - Blog: removed. Look for Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Blog.
    - Spell: Fixed a spelling mistake.
    - Infobot: Fixed annoying parser bugs. Needs to re-write whole thing soon.
    - Karma: Removed case-sensitivity in karma objects.
