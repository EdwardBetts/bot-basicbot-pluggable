0.30
  - Improved docs
  - Synced version number with Bot::BasicBot again
  - Added NINJA support
  - Moved to Module::Build-based module layout
  - Huge docs improvement, based on feedback from people who clearly had no
    idea what I waas smoking at the time.
  - Decent examples in examples/, and copies on the web page for people
    who use CPAN
  - Removed the Blog and Shout modules - blog is to be spun off into a
    seperate module, Shout was just stupid.
  - Support for loading modules from a 'modules' folder in cwd as well
    as from the main perl lib path.
  - The bot is a lot less case-sensitive. Still sensitive for loading modules,
    but all the help, etc commands are more friendly.
  - Removed 'reply' method (now in Bot::BasicBot)
  - Slight module API changes, nothing significant, and I don't know of any
    3rd party modules anyway:
    - Added a 'tick' callback that happens every 5 seconds.
    - Added a 'reply' local method that mirrors the Bot::BasicBot reply.
    - Added a 'say' method that calls the Bot::BasicBot say.
    - Added a very simple 'tell' method for simple statements
    - Added an 'emoted' callback that works identically to the 'said'
      callback
    - Added a 'chanjoin' callback, called when someone joins a channel
    - Added a 'chanpart' callback, called when someone leaves a channel
  - Module changes (other than doc improvements):
    - Auth
      - Fixed silly bug that meant you didn't actually need to auth
      - Now requires direct addressing
      - Smarter about ignoring things that aren't admin commands
    - Blog
      - Removed. Look for Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Blog, coming
        soon!
    - Spell
      - Fixed a spelling mistake
    - Infobot
      - Fixed a bunck of annoying parser bugs. I need to re-write the whole
        thing soon, though.
    - Karma
      - Removed case-sensitivity in karma objects.
